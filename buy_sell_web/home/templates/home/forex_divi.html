Owing to price changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange contracts and cross-currency contracts, the combination of high leverage and low margin can lead to significant losses. The initial margin can be small when you compare it with the value of foreign currency and so the transactions can be leveraged. Customers need to maintain the minimum margin requirements for the open position at all times. It is the duty of the customer to keep an eye and monitor his net outstanding balance. If the minimum requirement is not maintained, we hold the right to liquidate all open positions. Similarly, leverages too can lead to high gains as well as losses.</span></span></span></h3>

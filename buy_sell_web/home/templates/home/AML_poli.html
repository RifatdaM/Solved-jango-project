<h3 class="western" align="justify"><strong><font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Anti-Money
Laundering Policy (AML)</font></font></strong></h3>

<p class="western" align="justify"><font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif">The
money laundering is the criminal process of converting the amounts of
illegally obtained money (by terrorism, corruption, drug dealing,
etc.) with hiding its true source into legal investments. It happens
because illegal nature of such funds will not be discovered due to
them becoming of material values.<br/>
<br/>
The government of every
country fights against money laundering and terroristic financial
operations because it is necessary to prevent the entry of criminal
funds into the economy. Financial and commercial institutions are the
most easily accessible for illegal processes of terroristic and
criminal organizations. Especially digital currency services are
vulnerable. Thus, ExonTime company takes an active part in the
prevention of such criminal activity in the whole world.<br/>
<br/>
For
these goals we do the following actions:<br/>
1. We conduct the
process of verification of the client’s identity and personal
information and monitor all transactions made by customers.<br/>
2.
Our team traces all suspicious operations of users and also those
made under irregular circumstances.<br/>
3. If our company suspects
the illegal activity or money laundering, it has the full right to
request additional verification or cancel such transaction at any
step.<br/>
4. According to the international law, ExonTime is not
obligated to give customer any notifications about suspicion in the
user’s criminal actions.<br/>
5. Such company’s actions are based
on the AML FATF references.<br/>
<br/>
To prevent the suspicious
operations and verify the client’s identity, the team of our
company has the right to update its electronic system on the regular
basis according to new regulations (if those appear). We also arrange
various trainings for our staff for improving the methods of struggle
against money laundering.</font></p>
